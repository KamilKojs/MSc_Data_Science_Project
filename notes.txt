experiment1:
    using time series models and picking prediction with the highest probability,
    I actually picked prediction where any number in proba was the highest so
    it might have been wrong, I might have been picking preds that indicate negative proba...
experiment2:
    fixed the bug in experiment1 and rerun


next steps:
 - discuss on how much training data is needed to use such system
 - increase logging (each step separately), time breakdown, scenarios if model is kicked out in case of wrong prediction
 - more analysis on intuition on time series models performance, why hit miss increases time for prediction
 - experiment for multiple models on single GPU (or multiple GPU's), while still doing serving one by one
